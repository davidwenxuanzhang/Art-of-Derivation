# Art-of-Derivation

This project aims to demystify the complex derivation process behind those mathematical theories and deepen my mathematical interest. 

All the documents in this project are coded through LaTeX in Overleaf. All my coding skills in LaTeX are self-learned, and many of them are unaesthetic or malformed. I personally don't want to rectify them, as they represent the traces of growth in my code. 

You can visit the left column and use the file "Derivation" to enjoy those projects, or kindly visit [Derivation](https://github.com/davidwenxuanzhang/Art-of-Derivation/tree/main/Derivation) to discover directly. 

This project is inspired by the probability textbook [*Art of Chance*](https://dlsun.github.io/skis/) I used in the 2025 Stanford Summer Session STATS 117 course.

I am new to GitHub and haven't yet acquired the skills to transform this page into a website as a high school student. I wish to learn more, and if you have any suggestions, please contact my personal email [davidwenxuanzhang@gmail.com](mailto:davidwenxuanzhang@gmail.com)

Finally, thank you to all the people who contributed to my math journey:\
(list will be complete after I graduate from high school)\
This is a gift for you all.
