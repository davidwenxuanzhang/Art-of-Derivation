# Art-of-Derivation

This project aims to demystify the complex derivation process behind those mathematical theories and deepen my mathematical interest. 

All the documents in this project are coded through LaTeX in Overleaf. All my coding skills in LaTeX are self-learned, and many of them are unaesthetic or malformed. I personally don't want to rectify them, as they represent the traces of growth in my code.
