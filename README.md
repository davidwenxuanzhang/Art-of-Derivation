# Art-of-Derivation

This project aims to demystify the complex derivation process behind those mathematical theories and deepen my mathematical interest. 

All the documents in this project are coded through LaTeX in Overleaf. All my coding skills in LaTeX are self-learned, and many of them are unaesthetic or malformed. I personally don't want to rectify them, as they represent the traces of growth in my code. 

You can kindly visit [Derivation](https://github.com/davidwenxuanzhang/Art-of-Derivation/tree/main/Derivation) to discover and enjoy those projects directly.\
Here are some projects I spent a lot of effort on: [Integration Formula](https://github.com/davidwenxuanzhang/Art-of-Derivation/blob/main/Derivation/Calculus/Integral%20Formula%20Derivation.pdf), [Intro to Bernoulli Number](https://github.com/davidwenxuanzhang/Art-of-Derivation/blob/main/Derivation/Algebra/Intro%20to%20Bernoulli%20Number.pdf), [Basel Problem](https://github.com/davidwenxuanzhang/Art-of-Derivation/blob/main/Derivation/Algebra/Basel%20problem.pdf).

This project is inspired by the probability textbook [*Art of Chance*](https://dlsun.github.io/skis/) I used in the 2025 Stanford Summer Session STATS 117 course.

I am new to GitHub and haven't yet acquired the skills to transform this page into a website. I wish to learn more, and if you have any suggestions, please contact my personal email [davidwenxuanzhang@gmail.com](mailto:davidwenxuanzhang@gmail.com).
